<!--  Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category -->
* Statiscally typed JavaScript.
- Type checking is completed at compile time.
- Explicit type declarations are ususally required.
- Errors are detected earlier.
- Variable assignments are static and cannot be changed.
- Produces more optimized code.

Some common examples of programming languages that belong to this category are Java, Haskell, C, C++, C#, Scala, Kotlin, Fortran, Go, Pascal, and Swift.


* Dynamically typed JavaScript
- Type checking is completed during runtime.
- Explicit declarations are not required.
- Type errors are detected later during execution.
- Variable assignments are dynamic and can be altered.
- Produces less optimized code, runtime errors are possible.

Some examples of programming languages that belong to this category are Python, JavaScript, Lisp, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Lua, and Tcl.

<!-- Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined &nbsp; -->
*Null 
- Null in JavaScript is an assignment value. You can assign it to a variable.
- It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript
- Null an object.

*Undefined 
- It means a variable declared, but no value has been assigned a value.
- It means the value does not exist in the compiler. It is the global object.
- undefined is a type.
